<h2 class="title">9.401 Assignment, Week 8, 11/2022: Interactive Webpage</h2>
</header>
Nick Watters

<p style="color:red">
    How can we make science more accessible to a broader public, including
    non-expert readers from neighboring disciplines, students and the public
    with varying levels of expertise? What is the role of graphic design, visual
    communication, and other 'non-traditional' modes of scientific communication
    in our work?
</p>

<p>
    I fully agree with the readings this week arguing for non-traditional modes
    of scientific communication! Well-crafted visuals and interactive demos can
    be so much more effective than traditional papers. Chris Olah (co-founder of
    Distill) had a huge effect on me personally. I remember reading his
    <a href="https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-09-Visual-Information/">
        introduction to information theory</a>
    in college, and to this day I remember that blog post better than all of the
    classes I took that covered information theory. I've since read all of
    Chris's posts, which always use graphics and interactive plots to great
    effect. Similarly, I'm a huge fan of Distill, and learned so much from the
    beautifully-crafted publications there. 3Blue1Brown is also a channel I've
    been a fan of for a long time --- I've watched all of their videos and some
    of them are permanently ingrained in my memory even years later (such as the
    beautiful and mind-blowing
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmgkSdhK4K8&ab_channel=3Blue1Brown">
        inscribed rectangle post</a>).
</p>

<p>
    I've long been inspired by Distill-style posts, and a few years ago even
    began drafting my own submission to Distill on variational autoencoders.
    Unfortunately I dropped that project because it was taking so much time, but
    I do hope to make interactive webpages for my future publications to explain
    concepts more clearly and to a broader audience than is possible with a
    traditional paper.
</p>

<p>
    I wish more scientists would use animations and interactive plots to show
    their work. However, there are two major obstacles:
    <ul>
    <li>
        There is little incentive. Scientists are evaluated primarily based on
        publications in journals, particularly high-impact journals. And
        high-impact journals are still stuck in the traditional mode.
    </li>
    <li>
        Making nice graphics and interactive webpages is time-consuming, often
        frustrating, and requires technical skills. For example, making the
        interactive plot on this page (see below) took more than two hours and
        involved programming in multiple langauges (in this case python,
        javascript, and html).
    </li>
    </ul>
    I think these obstacles can and should be overcome. For example:
    <ul>
    <li>
        Major journals should accept papers with animations and interactive
        plots. They could create a separate category for these (like review
        papers, articles, opinion papers, ...). I would absolutely submit an
        interactive paper if it were an option at the leading journals in my
        field!
    </li>
    <li>
        MIT or the BCS department could offer resources to help us make
        interactive posts about our research. For example, imagine a small team
        of web and/or graphics designers that each week take one paper from the
        MIT community and make a blog post about it. That would be fantastic,
        and might benefit the broader public if the posts are interactive and
        accessible without assuming much background knowledge.
    </li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p style="color:red">
    For a paper you know well, draft one of: an interactive executable paper, a
    cartoon paper, a video abstract, 'two minute paper', a podcast, an oral
    story, twitter thread OR a blog post. This can be a draft; you're not
    required to make a finished project. Attach your product with your response
    paper. Explicitly say, who is your intended audience.
</p>

    <h3>Commentary</h2>
</header>

<p>
    The following section of this webpage is my draft of an interactive post.
    First, I'll say a few words about the tools I used. I used
    <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> to host this page. I
    really like GitHub Pages, because: (i) it is free, (ii) the code
    implementing the webpage is in a GitHub repository, which lends nice version
    control features. You can use the same GitHub repo for code, data, and
    webpage. This makes it a one-stop shop for a research project: When you
    open-source the code and data for a paper, you can have a webpage with
    interactive plots in the same repo and GitHub will host it.
</p>
<p>
    To make the interactive plot below, I used javascript. Specifically, I used
    <a href="https://plotly.com/javascript/">Plotly.js</a>, which has a bunch of
    open-sourced tools for embedding plots in html webpages. For the data, I
    pushed a dataset (from a research project) to
    <a href="https://github.com/nwatters01/interactive_plot">the same GitHub
        repo as the code for this webpage</a>,
    which is loaded by the javascript code to make the plots below.
</p>
<p>
    Overall, making this website was not difficult. I'm not an expert at html or
    javascript so I had to spend a little time debugging, but with practice this
    would probably become very easy, like Latex or Markdown. I'm now seriously
    considering making an interactive website for the next paper I write.

    <h3 name="factorization_post">Factorized Representations for
        Generalization</h2>
</header>

<p>
    There's a lot of text I'd write here motivating and describing the project,
    since my intended audience would be broad (anyone with high school level
    math). But for this assignment I'm just going to focus on the visualizations
    and interactive plot, so won't describe the science at all. I'll just
    mention that we define a "factorized" embedding \(f\) to be one that
    decomposes as a linear sum \(f(x, y) = f_x(x) + f_y(y)\). We then show that
    factorized embeddings facilitate generalization of neural network models to
    novel stimuli. Moreover, factorization seems to be exactly the criteria that
    best predicts generalization, as opposed to linear decodability of factors,
    orthogonality, disentangling, or other measures of structure in the
    embedding.
</p>

<p>
    Below are some embedded animations showing spatial transformations. A
    shearing (far left) preserves factorization. A distortion (center left) does
    not preserve factorization. A quadratic warp (center right) preserves
    factorization. A quartic warp (far right) does not preserve factorization.
</p>

    adjust the factorization score. Click and drag the plot to rotate it. Scroll
    to zoom. Additional controls are in the panel in the top-right.

    Look at a science graphics website, like biorender. Is there an image that
    would help you communicate your own research in clear and appealing
    graphics?
</p>
<p>
    Yes, biorender is fantastic! I didn't know about it, but now am glad I do!
    It has many nice images. Here are a few relevant to my research:

<p style="color:red">
    Find a non-traditional format for scientific communication (one of: an
    interactive Notebook, a cartoon paper, a video abstract, 'two minute
    papers', a podcast, an oral story, twitter thread, dance, OR a blog post),
    and the associated paper. Give an example of something that is communicated
    more clearly in the non-traditional format.
</p>

<p>
    I'll mention
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGHKFMXdjKU&ab_channel=TwoMinutePapers">
        this post</a>
    from "two minute papers", about 
    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.11390">a paper</a> my collaborators and
    I wrote a few years ago. This paper introduces a method to decompose and
    represent a visual scene as a composition of objects. Both the
    <a href="https://twitter.com/DeepMind/status/1109135265606569985">associated 
        twitter post</a>
    and the two-minute papers video communicate the behavior of the model a lot
    more clearly than the static paper, because the videos allowed us to show
    the model's "reconstruction" as the latent space was continuously traversed
    (e.g. <a href="https://youtu.be/mGHKFMXdjKU?t=51">minute 0:51</a> in the
    two-minute papers video).
</p>

<p>
    The twitter thread and the two-minute papers video were better modalities
    for communicating this work because they allowed video. They also both
    likely contributed to a larger readership. However, they took a lot of time.
    I remember spending many days with a couple of the other authors working on
    the videos for the twitter thread, and several meetings with Karoly
    discussing and preparing materials for the two-minute papers video.
