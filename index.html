<h2 class="title">9.401 Assignment, Week 8, 11/2022: Interactive Webpage</h2>
</header>
Nick Watters

<p style="color:red">
    How can we make science more accessible to a broader public, including
    non-expert readers from neighboring disciplines, students and the public
    with varying levels of expertise? What is the role of graphic design, visual
    communication, and other 'non-traditional' modes of scientific communication
    in our work?
</p>

<p>
    I fully agree with the readings this week arguing for non-traditional modes
    of scientific communication! Well-crafted visuals and interactive demos can
    be so much more effective than traditional papers. Personally, Chris Olah
    (co-founder of Distill) had a huge effect on me. I remember reading his
    <a href="https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-09-Visual-Information/">
        introduction to information theory</a>
    in college. To this day I remember that blog post better than all of the
    classes I took that covered information theory. I've since read all of
    Chris's posts, which always use graphics and interactive plots to great
    effect. Similarly, I'm a huge fan of Distill, and learned so much from the
    beautifully-crafted publications there. 3Blue1Brown is also a channel I've
    been a fan of for a long time --- I've watched all of their videos and some
    of them are permanently ingrained in my memory, even years later (such as
    the
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmgkSdhK4K8&ab_channel=3Blue1Brown">
        inscribed rectangle post</a>).
</p>

<p>
    I've always admired Distill-style posts, and a few years ago even began
    drafting my own submission to Distill on variational autoencoders.
    Unfortunately I dropped that project because it was taking so much time, but
    one day I hope to make interactive webpages for my future publications to
    explain concepts more clearly than is possible in a static paper.
</p>

<p>
    I wish more scientists would use alternative modes of communication.
    However, there are two major obstacles to this:
    <ul>
    <li>
        There is little incentive. Scientists are evaluated primarily based on
        publications in journals, particularly high-impact journals. And
        high-impact journals are still primarily stuck in the traditional mode.
    </li>
    <li>
        Making nice graphics and interactive webpages is time-consuming, often
        frustrating, and requires technical skills. For example, making the
        interactive plot on this page (see below) took a couple hours of work
        and involved programming in multiple langauges (in this case python,
        javascript, and html).
    </li>
    </ul>
    I think these obstacles can and should be overcome. For example:
    <ul>
    <li>
        Major journals can include interactive papers. This could be in a
        separate category (like review papers, articles, opinion papers, ...).
        I would absolutely submit an interactive paper if it were an option at
        the journals my lab typically submits to!
    </li>
    <li>
        MIT or the BCS department could offer resources to help us make
        interactive posts about our research. For example, imagine a small team
        of web and/or graphics designers that each week take one paper from the
        MIT community and make a blog post about it. That would be fantastic!
    </li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p style="color:red">
    For a paper you know well, draft one of: an interactive executable paper, a
    cartoon paper, a video abstract, 'two minute paper', a podcast, an oral
    story, twitter thread OR a blog post. This can be a draft; you're not
    required to make a finished project. Attach your product with your response
    paper. Explicitly say, who is your intended audience.

    <h3>Commentary</h2>
</header>

<p>
    The following section of this webpage is my draft of an interactive post.
    First, I'll say a few words about the tools I used. I used
    <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> to host this page. I
    really like GitHub Pages, because: (i) it is free, (ii) the code
    implementing the webpage is in a GitHub repository, which lends nice version
    control features. You can use the same GitHub repo for code, data, and
    webpage. This makes it a one-stop shop for a research project: When you
    open-source the code and data for a paper, you can have a webpage with
    interactive plots in the same repo and GitHub will host it.
</p>
<p>
    To make the interactive plot below, I used javascript. Specifically, I used
    <a href="https://plotly.com/javascript/">Plotly.js</a>, which has a bunch of
    open-sourced tools for embedding plots in html webpages. For the data, I
    pushed a dataset (from a research project) to
    <a href="https://github.com/nwatters01/interactive_plot">the same GitHub
        repo as the code for this webpage</a>,
    which is loaded by the javascript code to make the plots below.
</p>
<p>
    Overall, making this website was not difficult. I'm not an expert at html or
    javascript so I had to spend a little time debugging, but with practice this
    would probably become very easy, like Latex or Markdown. I'm now seriously
    considering making an interactive website for the next paper I write.

    Look at a science graphics website, like biorender. Is there an image that
    would help you communicate your own research in clear and appealing
    graphics?
</p>
<p>
    Yes, biorender is fantastic! I didn't know about it, but now am glad I do!
    It has many nice images. Here are a few relevant to my research:

    Find a non-traditional format for scientific communication (one of: an
    interactive Notebook, a cartoon paper, a video abstract, 'two minute
    papers', a podcast, an oral story, twitter thread, dance, OR a blog post),
    and the associated paper. Give an example of something that is communicated
    more clearly in the non-traditional format.
